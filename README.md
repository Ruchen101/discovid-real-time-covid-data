# discovid-real-time-covid-data
This mobile app project was inspired by the need to identify Covid confirmed cases in real-time by health officials. Users could log in and visualise cases using the Google Maps API. Location data was generated from the mobile phones GPS and locked to a shared cloud database - Firebase. The stack used to develop this app includes DART, Flutter SDK, Android Studio. The code showcased here is only a fraction of the entire application.
